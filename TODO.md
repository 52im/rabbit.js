## Fixes

 * Make sure temp queues get tidied up
 * MessageStream should 'inherit' from Stream, possibly

## Wishlist

 * Client library that e.g., keeps track of the req/rep state machine
 * Include topics and subscriptions in sockets (third part of message?)

## Ideas

 * 'Direct mode' client in node
 * Use Rabbit-STOMP's idea of destinations

## (Done)
